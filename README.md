# Database System
An exercise in development, I have tried to emulate a database system in Java.

Currently, the Table and Record classes can represent any standard relational table and record respectively. 
A Table can be saved to and loaded from a file using the TableFileReadWriter class, and can be pretty printed to the console using the TablePrinter class.
