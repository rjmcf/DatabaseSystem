# Database System 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rjmcf/DatabaseSystem.svg?branch=addDatabaseClass)](https://travis-ci.org/rjmcf/DatabaseSystem)

An exercise in development, I have tried to emulate a database system in Java.

Currently, the Table and Record classes can represent any standard relational table and record respectively. 
A Table can be saved to and loaded from a file using the TableFileReadWriter class, and can be pretty printed to the console using the TablePrinter class.
